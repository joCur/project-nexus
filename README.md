# Project Nexus
*The Intelligent Knowledge Workspace*

## ðŸš€ Elevator Pitch

### The Vision
Nexus is the digital workspace that thinks with you. Imagine a fusion of Obsidian's powerful linking capabilities, Pinterest's visual pinboard, and an AI assistant that understands and connects your thoughts.

### The Problem
Our thoughts, ideas, and notes are scattered everywhere - across different apps, on sticky notes, in chats. Even in good note-taking apps, we lose overview and miss connections between our ideas. Valuable insights gather digital dust because we can't find them or see how they relate to each other.

### The Solution
Nexus provides a visual, AI-powered workspace where users can:

- **Place thoughts as cards** on an infinite canvas (text, images, links, code)
- **Use Markdown** for structured notes
- **Let AI automatically visualize** connections between related ideas
- **Query their notes**: "What do I know about X?"
- **Seamlessly switch** between Mobile App (Quick Capture with Flutter) and Web (Deep Work with Next.js)

### The Unique Value Proposition
While other note-taking apps just store, Nexus understands your content. AI works in the background as your personal knowledge curator - finding patterns, suggesting connections, and helping you see the bigger picture.

### Target Audience
Knowledge workers, students, creatives - anyone who works with information and whose value lies not in collecting, but in connecting ideas.
