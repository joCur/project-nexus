# Project Nexus - Product Management Specification

## Executive Summary

### Elevator Pitch
Nexus is a visual AI-powered workspace that automatically connects and organizes your thoughts, ideas, and knowledge like a personal knowledge curator.

### Problem Statement
Knowledge workers lose valuable insights and connections because their thoughts are scattered across multiple applications, making it impossible to see patterns and relationships between ideas, resulting in duplicated effort and missed opportunities for innovation.

### Target Audience
**Primary Segments:**
- Knowledge Workers (25-45 years, corporate professionals)
- Graduate Students & Researchers (22-35 years, academic environment)
- Creative Professionals (20-50 years, design/content creation)

### Unique Selling Proposition
Unlike traditional note-taking apps that merely store information, Nexus actively understands, connects, and visualizes relationships between your ideas using AI, transforming scattered thoughts into an interconnected knowledge graph.

### Success Metrics
- **User Activation Rate**: 60% of users create 10+ cards within first week
- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: 40% of monthly active users
- **Connection Discovery Rate**: Average 5 AI-suggested connections accepted per user per week
- **Cross-Platform Usage**: 70% of users utilize both mobile and web within 30 days
- **Knowledge Retrieval Speed**: 80% reduction in time to find related information

## Feature Specifications

### Feature: Infinite Canvas with Smart Cards
**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to place different types of content as cards on a visual canvas, so that I can organize my thoughts spatially and see everything at once.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a blank canvas, when I create a new card, then I can choose between text, image, link, or code card types
- Given multiple cards on canvas, when I drag cards, then they maintain their relative positions
- Given a canvas with 100+ cards, when I navigate, then performance remains smooth (<100ms response time)
- Edge case: When offline, cards are cached locally and sync when connection restored

**Priority:** P0 (Core functionality)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given cards with content, when AI analyzes them, then connections appear as visual links
- Given new card creation, when content is added, then AI suggests connections within 2 seconds
- Given connection suggestions, when I review them, then I can accept/reject/modify
- Edge case: When AI confidence is low (<70%), connections are shown as dotted lines

**Priority:** P0 (Key differentiator)
**Dependencies:** AI/ML pipeline, Natural Language Processing service
**Technical Constraints:** AI processing must not block UI interaction
**UX Considerations:** Non-intrusive connection suggestions, adjustable AI sensitivity

### Feature: Markdown-Enhanced Note Taking

### Feature: Natural Language Knowledge Queries
**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to query my knowledge base using natural language, so that I can quickly find relevant information without remembering exact keywords.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a query "What do I know about X?", when submitted, then relevant cards are highlighted
- Given query results, when displayed, then they show relevance scores
- Given complex queries with multiple concepts, when processed, then results show connections
- Edge case: When no results found, AI suggests related topics from existing cards

**Priority:** P0 (Core value proposition)
**Dependencies:** Search infrastructure, NLP query processor
**Technical Constraints:** Query response time <2 seconds for databases up to 10,000 cards
**UX Considerations:** Search bar prominence, query history, suggested queries
