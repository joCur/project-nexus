\# Implement Command



You are tasked with implementing a plan Step-by-Step in an organized and methodical fashion. Follow these steps:



\## Implementation Process



1\. \*\*Load the Plan\*\*: First, look for the plan and read it

2\. \*\*Set Up Tracking\*\*: Use the TodoWrite tool to create a todo list based on the plan's implementation tasks

3\. \*\*Implement Step-by-Step\*\*: Work through each task systematically:

&nbsp;   - Mark current task as in\_progress

&nbsp;   - Implement the task completely (use the most appropriate subagent)

&nbsp;   - Test the implementation if applicable

&nbsp;   - You MUST update the plan as you go

&nbsp;   - Mark task as completed before moving to next

4\. \*\*Validate Progress\*\*: After each major task, ensure the implementation works as expected



\## Implementation Guidelines



\- \*\*Follow the Plan\*\*: Stick to the tasks outlined in the plan unless you discover issues that require deviation

\- \*\*One Task at a Time\*\*: Only work on one task at a time, completing it fully before moving on

\- \*\*Orchestration First\*\*: Orchestrate implementation tasks to the appropriate subagent, don't write code yourself

\- \*\*Test as You Go\*\*: Run tests, lints, and basic validation after each significant change

\- \*\*Update Documentation\*\*: Keep any relevant documentation updated as you implement

\- \*\*Handle Blockers\*\*: If you encounter issues not anticipated in the plan, create additional todos to track resolution

\- \*\*Keep Track\*\*: Use the plan as a living document, updating as needed



\## Task Management



\- Use TodoWrite tool to track all implementation tasks

\- Mark tasks as in\_progress when starting work

\- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing

\- Add new tasks if you discover additional work needed

\- Break down large tasks into smaller ones if needed



\## Quality Assurance



\- Make sure the code builds after code changes

\- Execute relevant tests to ensure nothing breaks

\- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

\- Ensure proper error handling and edge case coverage



\## Communication



\- Keep the user informed of progress without being verbose

\- Report any deviations from the original plan and why

\- Ask for clarification if plan details are unclear

\- Summarize what was accomplished at the end

\*\*Plan to implement\*\*: {{ARGS}}



If no plan name is provided, ask the user to specify which plan to implement. 

Then implement the plan following the step-by-step process above.
