# Canvas Default Setting Bug Fix

## Issue
When setting a canvas as default, the backend properly cleared the previous default using `clearDefaultCanvas()` and set the new one, but there were potential race conditions that could result in:
- Multiple default canvases in a workspace
- Frontend not getting complete state updates
- Race conditions during concurrent operations

## Root Cause Analysis
- **No transaction safety**: The `clearDefaultCanvas()` and `setDefaultCanvas()` operations were separate, non-atomic operations
- **No validation**: No post-operation verification that only one default exists per workspace
- **Limited logging**: Insufficient logging for debugging default canvas state changes
- **Race conditions**: Concurrent requests could interfere with each other

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Transaction Safety ✅
- Wrapped the entire `setDefaultCanvas` operation in a database transaction
- Made clearing existing defaults and setting new default atomic
- Ensures rollback on any failure during the operation

### 2. Post-Operation Validation ✅
- Added validation within the transaction to verify only one default canvas exists
- Throws error if constraint violation is detected
- Validates the correct canvas was set as default

### 3. Enhanced Logging ✅
- Added detailed logging at operation start with context
- Log clearing operation results with count
- Log validation results with canvas details
- Track operation timing for performance monitoring
- Enhanced error logging with stack traces

### 4. Early Return Optimization ✅
- Check if canvas is already default before executing transaction
- Return immediately if no operation needed
- Reduces unnecessary database operations

### 5. Improved Error Handling ✅
- Better error messages for constraint violations
- Proper transaction rollback on validation failures
- Enhanced GraphQL resolver error handling

## Code Changes

### `backend/src/services/canvas.ts`
- **Modified `setDefaultCanvas()` method**:
  - Added early return for already-default canvases
  - Wrapped operations in database transaction
  - Added comprehensive validation within transaction
  - Enhanced logging with timing and detailed context
  - Better error handling with stack traces

### `backend/src/graphql/canvasResolvers.ts`
- **Updated `setDefaultCanvas` resolver**:
  - Enhanced error logging with error type and stack trace
  - Always publish real-time events for frontend synchronization
  - Better error re-throwing for specific error types

### `backend/src/__tests__/unit/services/canvas.test.ts`
- **Updated tests for new transaction-based implementation**:
  - Mock transaction callbacks properly
  - Test early return scenarios
  - Test validation failure scenarios
  - Test transaction rollback scenarios

### `backend/src/__tests__/integration/canvas-default-concurrency.test.ts`
- **New integration test file**:
  - Tests concurrent setDefaultCanvas operations
  - Validates transaction safety under load
  - Tests validation failure scenarios
  - Performance and timing tests

## Database Schema
The existing unique constraint remains unchanged:
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_canvases_workspace_default_unique
ON canvases(workspace_id) WHERE is_default = true
```

This constraint ensures only one default canvas per workspace at the database level.

## Testing
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ New unit tests for transaction scenarios
- ✅ New integration tests for concurrency
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No regressions in full test suite

## Benefits
1. **Eliminates race conditions**: Transaction safety prevents concurrent modification issues
2. **Data consistency**: Post-operation validation ensures constraint compliance
3. **Better debugging**: Enhanced logging provides detailed operation tracking
4. **Performance**: Early return optimization reduces unnecessary operations
5. **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and transaction rollback

## API Behavior
The GraphQL API behavior remains unchanged from the frontend perspective:
- Same input/output format
- Same error handling
- Real-time updates via subscriptions continue to work
- Performance should be equal or better due to optimizations

## Deployment Notes
- No database migrations required
- No frontend changes required
- Backward compatible
- Safe to deploy without downtime

## Monitoring
The enhanced logging provides better observability:
- Operation timing metrics
- Validation success/failure tracking
- Error details with stack traces
- Canvas state change tracking

This fix makes the canvas default setting operation atomic, bulletproof, and fully traceable.
