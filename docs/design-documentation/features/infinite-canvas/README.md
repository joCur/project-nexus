# Infinite Canvas Interface Design

## Feature Overview
The infinite canvas is the core workspace where users organize knowledge as visual cards with AI-powered connections. This interface combines spatial thinking with intelligent automation to create an intuitive knowledge management experience.

## User Experience Analysis

### Primary User Goal
Create a visual knowledge workspace that allows spatial organization of thoughts while leveraging AI to discover and visualize meaningful connections between ideas.

### Success Criteria
- Users can intuitively place and organize cards in 2D space
- AI connections are visually clear without overwhelming the interface
- Canvas performance remains smooth with 1000+ cards
- Navigation feels natural across different zoom levels

### Key Pain Points Addressed
- **Information Overwhelm**: Visual spatial organization reduces cognitive load
- **Missing Connections**: AI automatically identifies and visualizes relationships
- **Context Switching**: Single canvas view maintains context across related ideas
- **Scale Management**: Progressive disclosure and zoom controls handle complexity

### User Personas Served

**Sarah Chen (Product Manager)**
- Uses canvas to connect user research findings with product requirements
- Benefits from AI connections between different user interview sessions
- Needs clear visual hierarchy to present insights to stakeholders

**Marcus Johnson (PhD Student)**
- Organizes research papers and experimental data on visual canvas
- Relies on AI to identify unexpected connections between studies
- Requires detailed view controls for literature review workflows

**Elena Rodriguez (UX Designer)**
- Creates visual mood boards mixing images and design rationale
- Uses spatial organization to show design evolution and decisions
- Needs fluid creation workflow for rapid ideation sessions

## Performance Optimization

### Canvas Rendering Strategy

**Virtualization System**
- **Visible Area Rendering**: Only render cards in viewport plus buffer zone
- **Level-of-Detail**: Simplified card rendering at lower zoom levels
- **Connection Culling**: Hide connections below certain zoom thresholds
- **Memory Management**: Unload off-screen card content after timeout

**Target Performance Metrics**
- **60fps Smooth Pan/Zoom**: Maintain frame rate during navigation
- **<100ms Card Creation**: Instant feedback for card creation actions
- **<2s Canvas Load**: Full canvas load with 100 cards
- **1000+ Card Support**: Performance degradation threshold

### Animation Performance

**Hardware Acceleration**
- Use `transform` and `opacity` for all animations
- Leverage `will-change` property for known animations
- Implement `containment` for animation isolation

**Animation Priorities**
- **Critical**: Zoom, pan, card selection (60fps required)
- **Enhanced**: Connection animations, hover effects (30fps acceptable)
- **Decorative**: AI processing indicators, subtle flourishes (reduce for performance)

## Accessibility Specifications

### Keyboard Navigation

**Canvas Navigation**
- **Arrow Keys**: Pan canvas in cardinal directions
- **+/- Keys**: Zoom in/out with keyboard
- **Space**: Pan mode for arrow key navigation
- **Tab Order**: Logical progression through cards and controls

**Card Interaction**
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate between cards in creation order
- **Enter**: Open selected card for editing
- **Delete**: Remove selected card with confirmation
- **Escape**: Deselect current selection and return to canvas

### Screen Reader Support

**ARIA Labels and Descriptions**
```html
<!-- Canvas container -->
<div role="application" 
     aria-label="Knowledge canvas workspace"
     aria-describedby="canvas-instructions">
  
  <!-- Individual cards -->
  <article role="article"
           aria-labelledby="card-title-123"
           aria-describedby="card-content-123">
    
    <!-- Connection information -->
    <div role="complementary"
         aria-label="AI connections"
         aria-live="polite">
```

**Dynamic Content Announcements**
- New card creation: "Card created with title [title]"
- AI connections: "New connection suggested between [card1] and [card2]"
- Canvas navigation: "Moved to [region] of canvas, [count] cards visible"

### Visual Accessibility

**High Contrast Support**
- All connection lines maintain 3:1 contrast ratio minimum
- Card borders clearly visible in high contrast mode
- Focus indicators use system colors when available

**Motion Sensitivity**
- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`**: Disable animations when requested
- **Essential Motion Only**: Connection creation and card selection animations
- **Alternative Feedback**: Use color/border changes instead of motion when disabled

## Technical Implementation
