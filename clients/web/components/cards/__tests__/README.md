  - High contrast mode support
  - Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
  - Touch target sizes (44x44px minimum)
  - Voice control and switch navigation compatibility

## Performance Requirements

All components must meet the **<100ms feedback requirement**:

- **Edit Mode Entry**: < 100ms from double-click to editor display
- **Typing Feedback**: < 100ms per keystroke visual update
- **Save Operations**: < 100ms for local state updates
- **Mode Transitions**: < 100ms for all UI state changes

## Accessibility Standards

All components comply with **WCAG AA standards**:

- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality without mouse
- **Screen Reader Support**: Comprehensive ARIA labels and announcements
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus traps and restoration
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for mobile interactions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
Each component has isolated unit tests covering:
- Component rendering in different states
- User interaction handling
- Content validation and updates
- Error scenarios and edge cases

### Integration Tests
Cross-component tests covering:
- Store integration patterns
- Component communication
- Real-world user workflows
- Error recovery scenarios

### Performance Tests
Dedicated performance validation:
- Timing measurements for all interactions
- Large content stress testing
- Memory leak detection
- Concurrent operation handling

### Accessibility Tests
Comprehensive a11y validation:
- Automated accessibility scanning (axe-core)
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader announcement verification
- Visual accessibility (contrast, sizing)

## Running the Tests

### All Tests
```bash
npm test -- components/canvas/cards/__tests__/
```

### Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Component-specific tests
npm test -- InlineTextEditor.test.tsx
npm test -- InlineCodeEditor.test.tsx
npm test -- InlineLinkEditor.test.tsx
npm test -- CardEditOverlay.test.tsx

# Cross-cutting tests
npm test -- InlineEditingPerformance.test.tsx
npm test -- InlineEditingIntegration.test.tsx
npm test -- InlineEditingAccessibility.test.tsx
```

### Performance Tests Only
```bash
npm test -- InlineEditingPerformance.test.tsx
```

### Accessibility Tests Only
```bash
npm test -- InlineEditingAccessibility.test.tsx
```

## Test Environment Setup

### Required Dependencies
- `@testing-library/react`
- `@testing-library/jest-dom`
- `@testing-library/user-event`
- `jest-axe` (for accessibility testing)

### Mocks and Setup
Tests include comprehensive mocking of:
- `cardStore` and `canvasStore`
- Performance APIs for timing measurements
- Accessibility APIs for a11y testing
- Network requests for metadata fetching
- Konva components for canvas integration

## Success Criteria Validation

The test suite validates all success criteria from NEX-193:

- [x] Double-click on any card enters edit mode
- [x] All changes appear with <100ms latency
- [x] Escape key cancels changes and exits edit mode
- [x] Click outside saves and exits edit mode
- [x] Text editor supports basic markdown
- [x] Code editor has syntax highlighting
- [x] Link editor validates URLs
- [x] Changes persist via updateCard to store
- [x] Edit mode has clear visual indication
- [x] Keyboard navigation works properly

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Tests
When adding new functionality:
1. Add unit tests to the appropriate component test file
2. Add integration tests if the feature involves multiple components
3. Add performance tests if the feature affects timing
4. Add accessibility tests if the feature affects a11y

### Performance Test Updates
When modifying performance requirements:
1. Update timing assertions in `InlineEditingPerformance.test.tsx`
2. Ensure all components still meet the <100ms requirement
3. Add stress tests for new performance-critical features

### Accessibility Test Updates
When adding new UI elements:
1. Run axe-core tests to catch basic violations
2. Add keyboard navigation tests for new interactive elements
3. Verify screen reader announcements for state changes
4. Test color contrast for new visual elements

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Performance Test Failures
- **Issue**: Tests timing out or failing performance assertions
- **Solution**: Check for memory leaks, optimize rendering, use React.memo

### Accessibility Test Failures
- **Issue**: axe-core violations or keyboard navigation issues
- **Solution**: Add proper ARIA labels, fix focus management, improve contrast

### Integration Test Failures
- **Issue**: Store updates not working or state synchronization issues
- **Solution**: Verify mock setup, check async operation handling

### Flaky Tests
- **Issue**: Tests passing/failing inconsistently
- **Solution**: Add proper async waits, use fake timers consistently, improve mocking

This comprehensive test suite ensures that the inline editing system is robust, performant, accessible, and meets all requirements specified in NEX-193.
